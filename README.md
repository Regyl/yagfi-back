# Introduction
###### Why yet another good-first-issue project?
First of all, when I searched for projects to contribute, I met one thing. 
Existing projects does not support all variety of labels:
- good-first-issue
- status: ideal-for-contribution
- beginner-friendly
- help wanted
and others.

The second reason was smart filtering. I'd like to contribute into live projects. 
Many of existing good-first-issue issues are abandoned.

To compare with, look for other similar projects:
